                Welcome to the official Beneque website!
                <br><br><br>
                You can provide an sentence/phrase in English, and we will translate it to Beneque.
                <br><br>
                Beneque is not a fully developed language and if your English sentence/phrase contains a word that we have not defined in Beneque,
                the Beneque translation for that word will just be the original English word.
                <br><br>
                If you put more than one character of punctionation in a row (eg. "!!!!"), the Beneque version will only be one instance of that character in that spot (eg. "!")
